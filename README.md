# Recommendation-system
Created a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering approach in the Databricks with Hyperparameter Tuning on Rank, MaxIter, Alpha and regularization parameter.<br>
Recommended top 15 movies for each users.<br>
Tested dataset on different train test split ratio and evaluated the models using evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE. Split ratio of 80-20 is considered optimal for effective model predictions.
